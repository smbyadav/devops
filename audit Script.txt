#               Written in bourne shell so it can be run on different releases

# No warranty is implied or given with this script
# It is based on numerous security guidelines
# As with any system changes, the script should be vetted and
# changed to suit the environment in which it is being used

# Unless your organization is specifically using the service, disable it.
# The best defense against a service being exploited is to disable it.

# Even if a service is set to off the script will audit the configuration
# file so that if a service is re-enabled the configuration is secure
# Where possible checks are made to make sure the package is installed
# if the package is not installed the checks will not be run

# To do:
#
# - nosuid,noexec for Linux
# - Disable user mounted removable filesystems for Linux
# - Disable USB devices for Linux
# - Grub password
# - Restrict NFS client requests to privileged ports Linux
